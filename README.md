# Final Project: Deep Sedation Across Ethnicities

## Overview of the project 

<div style="text-align: right">We are creating a prototype app to sensibilize clinitians on the disparity degree of deep sedation on patients with accute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accross ethnicities. The relevance of this project is that deep sedation on the first five days administered is associated with higher mortality likelihood after 90 days. The first step was to understand two key concepts of the project: ARDS and deep sedation. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood institute; ARDS "is a serious lung condition that causes low blood oxygen", this condition is mainly caused by other deseases or injuries. This condition can develop at any age and quickly deteriorate[1].<div/>
  
<br/>  
  
<div style="text-align: right">In the manuscript[2] provided, “deep sedation is defined as the proportion of days during which the patient was deeply sedated, repeatedly measured once daily for the first five days that a patient was alive and receiving mechanical ventilation” (Armstrong-Hough, M. and et.al., 2022). And a day of deep sedation was defined as a day where the Richmond Agitation (Table 1) and Sedation Score [3] was equal to or less than -2, the Riker (Table 1) [3] Sedation Agitation Scale was equal to or greater than 1, or the Ramsay [4] Sedation Scale was equal to or greater than 4. The Richmond Agitation is defined as:<div/>

<br/>

  <div style="text-align: right">In order to assess the disparity in the degree of deep sedation across ethnicities,  the research team control for “patient characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, reported tobacco use, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), SOFA score, receipt of benzodiazepines" [3]. And after obtainig the different odds of exposure to deep sedation, they carried out "bivariate tests of association between patient characteristics and death within 90 days using chi-square tests.” The hypothesis that they were testing was “that Hispanic patients enrolled in the control arm of the ROSE trial spent more time deeply sedated than non-Hispanic patients and that greater exposure to deep sedation was associated with increased 90-day mortality” [3].<div/>

## Description of the problem
    
<div style="text-align: right">Mari Armstrong and her research team made a study on the disparity of deep sedation across ethnicities and associated this degree of sedation with the 90-day mortality rate. And they made interesting findings but they are looking for a better way to communicate this result to the clinicians. This to sensibilize and make clinicians conscious of the disparity in sedation administered and mortality rates to potentially influence their decisions taking on the degree of deep sedation.<div/>
  
## Description of the end user 
 
<div style="text-align: right">The end users will be critical care physicians that have understanding of statistical interpretation of linear regression. The question is if they also understand multilevel model interpretation and if they should require this to interpret the visualization.<div/>
 
## User Research and Testing Plan

### User research plan

<div style="text-align: right">Our research method will consist of three stages: Discover, Explore, Test. And these stages are described in the following sections.<div/>
 
#### Discover (Designed interview)
Clinician and any other user we have access to will need to answer the following interview questions:
 
* What is the primary patient outcome of interest (deep sedation/ mortality rate)?
* Is the main purpuse of this interactive app to sensibilize clinitians on the disparity of deep sedation?
* How are the visualizations going to help the decision making process?
* How does the visualization look for you?

#### Explore (User’s needs)
Participants will need to prioritize the following needs 

1. 	Statistical precision of modeling.
2. 	Simplicity in conveying a message to the clinitians. 
3. 	Design
4. 	Dynamicity
  
#### Test
This section and the results will be described in the prototyping and developing sections.  

### Testing plan
This testing plan is designed to collect information on the users experience of the Deep Sedation App. Which will help clinitians sensibilize with the disparities on deep sedation. 

#### Purpose, goals, and objectives of the test 
The goals of this test would be to:
*	Asses if the app is helping sensibilize clinitians about the problem. 
* Fine tunning the App prototype. 
  
#### Research questions 
Additionally, this research will try to answer the following questions:  
  
* Do you consider the design is appropriate?
* Did you find the dashboard useful?
* Is the visualization fullfilling the purpose of sensibilize?  
* Are the colors used appropriate?
* What would you modify?
  
#### Participant characteristics
  
There will be two main participants for this App. Professor Mari Armstrong-Hough, and Dr. Tomas Valley.

Methodology (test design)
This study will be exploratory to gather data the effectiveness of the Regression Assumption App. The users will fall into two groups depending on their mastery of the Regression Assumptions. 

The methodology for this study will be a within-subjects study, each participant will try all the sections of the App. I will conduct two individual one hour usability study sessions. In each session it will be a split of 50/50 between experience and novice users. I will use 20 minutes to introduce the participants to the session, review basic background information with the participant, and then conduct a post-test debriefing interview. And allow 40 minutes for the users to test the App.
Session outline and timing 
The test sessions will be one our long. I will use 20 minutes to introduce the session and conduct a post-test debriefing. The sessions will take place at the ASH study room in NYU. 
Pre-test arrangements 
Have the participant:
•	Review and sign nondisclosures and recording permissions.
•	Fill out a screener questionnaire. 
Introduction to the session (10 minutes)
Discuss:
•	Participant’s experience with usability studies.
•	Importance of their involvement in the study.
•	Moderator’s role.
•	The protocol for the session.
Background interview (10 minutes)
Discuss the participant’s:
•	Experience learning Regression Assumptions.
•	Purpose of learning Regression Assumptions. 
Tasks (30 min)
Participants will explore the Regression Assumptions App. 
Post-test debriefing (10 min)
•	Ask questions on how this App changed users’ concepts on Regression Assumption broad questions to collect data on the participants experience.
•	Ask questions on the design’s clarity of the App.  
•	Ask how this app could be improve. 
•	Follow up on any problems that came up. 

Task list 
1.	Let users read the instructions and analyze if they are clear. 
2.	Let users read the prerequisites and analyze if they are clear. 
3.	Take time on how long it takes users to read the prerequisites.
4.	Let users complete the challenge in the App and take time.
5.	Let users play with the game in the App and evaluate how useful it is. 

Test environment, equipment, and logistics 
I will use a controlled setting to conduct the sessions. The study will take place at the ASH study room in NYU. 
Participants will use a Windows PC and Google Chrome Version 99.0.04844.74 with a high-speed internet connection. Each participant will have a webcam to record their faces. And a software to record the screen. 
Test moderator role
The role of the moderator in this study will be a human factors specialist.
Data to be collected and evaluation measures
•	Clarity of the instructions.
•	Clarity of the pre-requisites.
•	Time to complete the pre-requisites.
•	What the users learnt from the game in the App. 
Report contents and presentation
The final report will be delivered to the sponsor of the project and will contain:
•	Background of the study, including goals, methodology, and participants characteristics. 
•	Findings for the research questions. 
•	Quantitative results.
•	Discussion on the implications of the results. 
•	Provides recommendations. 
•	Suggest follow-on research. 
The sponsor will review and comment on the draft. I will incorporate the agreed changes and then present a summary of the findings.
