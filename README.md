# Final Project: Deep Sedation Across Ethnicities

## Overview of the project 

<div style="text-align: right">We are creating a prototype app to sensibilize clinitians on the disparity degree of deep sedation on patients with accute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accross ethnicities. The relevance of this project is that deep sedation on the first five days administered is associated with higher mortality likelihood after 90 days. The first step was to understand two key concepts of the project: ARDS and deep sedation. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood institute; ARDS "is a serious lung condition that causes low blood oxygen", this condition is mainly caused by other deseases or injuries. This condition can develop at any age and quickly deteriorate[1].<div/>

<div style="text-align: right">In the manuscript[2] provided, “deep sedation is defined as the proportion of days during which the patient was deeply sedated, repeatedly measured once daily for the first five days that a patient was alive and receiving mechanical ventilation” (Armstrong-Hough, M. and et.al., 2022). And a day of deep sedation was defined as a day where the Richmond Agitation (Table 1) and Sedation Score [3] was equal to or less than -2, the Riker (Table 1) [3] Sedation Agitation Scale was equal to or greater than 1, or the Ramsay [4] Sedation Scale was equal to or greater than 4. The Richmond Agitation is defined as:<div/>

  <div style="text-align: right">In order to assess the disparity in the degree of deep sedation across ethnicities,  the research team control for “patient characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, reported tobacco use, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), SOFA score, receipt of benzodiazepines" [3]. And after obtainig the different odds of exposure to deep sedation, they carried out "bivariate tests of association between patient characteristics and death within 90 days using chi-square tests.” The hypothesis that they were testing was “that Hispanic patients enrolled in the control arm of the ROSE trial spent more time deeply sedated than non-Hispanic patients and that greater exposure to deep sedation was associated with increased 90-day mortality” [3].<div/>

## Description of the problem
    
<div style="text-align: right">Mari Armstrong and her research team made a study on the disparity of deep sedation across ethnicities and associated this degree of sedation with the 90-day mortality rate. And they made interesting findings but they are looking for a better way to communicate this result to the clinicians. This to sensibilize and make clinicians conscious of the disparity in sedation administered and mortality rates to potentially influence their decisions taking on the degree of deep sedation.<div/>
  
## Description of the end user 
 
<div style="text-align: right">The end users will be critical care physicians that have understanding of statistical interpretation of linear regression. The question is if they also understand multilevel model interpretation and if they should require this to interpret the visualization.<div/>
 
## User Research and Testing Plan

### User research plan

<div style="text-align: right">Our research method will consist of three stages: Discover, Explore, Test. And these stages are described in the following sections.<div/>
 
#### Discover (Designed interview)
Clinician and any other user we have access to will need to answer the following interview questions:
 
* What is the primary patient outcome of interest (deep sedation/ mortality rate)?
* Is the main purpuse of this interactive app to sensibilize clinitians on the disparity of deep sedation?
* How are the visualizations going to help the decision making process?
* How does the visualization look for you?

#### Explore (User’s needs)
Participants will need to prioritize the following needs 

1. 	Statistical precision of modeling.
2. 	Simplicity in conveying a message to the clinitians. 
3. 	Design
4. 	Dynamicity
  
#### Test
This section and the results will be described in the prototyping and developing sections.  

  
  
  
  
## Findings/results from interviews 
## Prototyping round 1
## Developments after round 1
## Plan for testing or getting feedback on the first round prototype
## Second round prototype - Application 
## Describe the latest version and, if applicable, any feedback you received (you may not get to this stage of feedback on the latest version)
## Link of Published Application
## Potential next steps
