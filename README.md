# Final Project: Deep Sedation Across Ethnicities

## Overview of the project 

We are creating a prototype app to sensibilize clinitians on the disparity degree of deep sedation on patients with accute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accross ethnicities. The relevance of this project is that deep sedation on the first five days administered is associated with higher mortality likelihood after 90 days. The first step was to understand the key concepts of the project: ARDS, deep sedation, and mortality likelihood. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood institute; ARDS "is a serious lung condition that causes low blood oxygen", this condition is mainly caused by other deseases or injuries. This condition can develop at any age and quickly deteriorate[1].

In the manuscript[2] provided, “deep sedation is defined as the proportion of days during which the patient was deeply sedated, repeatedly measured once daily for the first five days that a patient was alive and receiving mechanical ventilation” (Armstrong-Hough, M. and et.al., 2022). And a day of deep sedation was defined as a day where the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Score [3] was equal to or less than -2, the Riker [3] Sedation Agitation Scale was equal to or greater than 1, or the Ramsay [4] Sedation Scale was equal to or greater than 4. The Richmond Agitation is defined as:
